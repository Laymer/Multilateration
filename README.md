===============

Multilateration with 4 ref nodes

Input:  x,y coordinates of 4 reference nodes, fixed height of reference nodes, 4 distance estimates (one measured from each reference node)
	                     
Can be extended for more than 4 reference nodes

Executes the Multilateration equations

Return: Cartesian coordinate (x,y,z) for the unknown location.
